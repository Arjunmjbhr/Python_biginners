# What is python

1. Python is a general purpose programming language.
2. python is a high level programming language.
3. python is portable
4. python is an interpreted language.
5. python is strongly typed.
6. Python has huge set of libraries.

Note: Libraries basically are components with code already written to save you time.

# High and Low Level Languages.

## High-Level Programming Languages

- These are languages only human can understand.
- They need an interpreter or compiler for the machine to understand them.
- Examples include: python,Java,C#,C++,PHP,Ruby.
- high level languages are easy to learn
- high level languages are near to human languages.
- transilator is required
- programs in high level languages are slow in execution.

## Low Level Languages

- These are languages only machines can understand
- They do not need an interpreter or compiler.
- They are closer to computer hardware.
- Examples Include: Machine and Assembly Language.
- Low level languages are difficult to learn
- low level languages are far from human languages.
- no transilator needed
- programs in low-level languages are fast in execution.

# What is a compiler?

- A compiler transilate the entire source code into machine language before the source code is executed.

- examples of compiled languages include C and C++

1. transforms the entire source code
2. generate machine code
3. use more memory
4. compiled once and runs anytime.
5. more difficult to debug.
6. faster

# What is an interpreter?

- An interpreter transilate the sourcecode line by line into machine language before the sourcecode is executed.

- examples of interpreted languages include python and perl

1. transforms line by line sourcecode
2. does not generate machine code
3. less memory used
4. source code is interpreted each time.
5. easier to debug
6. slower

# Interacting with Python

- python shell console.
- python file
- command-line interface(Mac&Linux Terminal | windown-command Prompt)
- Python IDLE IDE( Integreted Development Envionment)

- windows cmd :python
- Mac or Linux: python3

- the print() function is used to print out text and other stuff on the console.

- python file (.py) | file with extension .py
- Text editor (Example : Notepad,vim) | text editor used to run the script
- IDE (Example: Visual Studio Code) | Development Environment for writing and running python scripts.

# Python Expressions ?

- An expression is anything that has "a value". Example 3, 'Hello world',3+4
- they can contain operators like + and operands like actual values like 3.

# in python Shell

3+4
9-4
"Hello World"

b= 7+7
print(b)

# Python Statements..

## what is a python statement?

- A statement is an instruction to the computer
- statement can be a single line or multiline
- python insterpreter translate the statement you write.

### Python Single line statement

7+7

print("Hello")

### multi line statement

\ or () used for multiline statements.

b = \
19\
+16\

print(b)

c= (
10+
20
)

print(c)

greetings = " hello"\
"I wish you the best"

print(greetings)
