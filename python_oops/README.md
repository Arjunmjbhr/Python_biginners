# Object Oriented Programming(OOP)

## Python OOPs

# What us OOP?

- Type of programming that breaks things into objects
- Object are created from classes.
- Object Oriented Programming encourages code reuse through D.R.Y concept (Don't repeat Yourself)

# what is Object?

- An Object can be an entity or anything in your program like a noun.
- Examples or real world objects includes things aroung us like Houses, cars,Bank accouts,pet etc.

# what is a Class?

- A class is a blueprint(template) for creating objects.
- Classes can have propertiess(attributes) which are like variables that store data.

- Classes can also have behaviours(methods). these are like functions.

- You can create many unique objects from a single class.

# Example for Classes

Lets take Car as a class

Class Car

Now the car has some attributes or else we can say it has some features.
For example

color
Engine
Door
Brand

Also the Car has some functionalities else we can say Methods

Start()
Stop()
Reverse()
Accelerate()

# Creating An Object (instatiating)

1. Attributes
   Red
   Petrol
   2 Doors
   Posche

- Methods()
  Start()
  Stop()
  Reverse()
  Accelerate()

2. Attributes
   Yellow
   Electric
   4 Doors
   Audi

- Methods
  Start()
  Stop()
  Reverse()
  Accelerate()

## Inporting Classes

- They can be imported into other programs like python modules

# Class Vs Instance(Object)Variables

## Class Variables

Defined Outside any method.
Accessed Outside class with ClassName
Not prefixed
Modifications affects all class instances
Classes are indented

## Instance(Object) Variables

Defined inside class methods.
Accessed outside class with objectName
prefixed with self keyword
Modifications to object local.
Instances are not indented
